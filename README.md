# Dotfiles

List of my dotfiles and configurations for easy setup of my dev environment. Feel free to look around. Right now I can version my dotfiles and backup/install names and versions of my global npm scripts.

For the dotfiles managment I'm using [dotfiles](https://github.com/jbernard/dotfiles) utility.

PS: sorry for czech, those are my internal notes what I want to add in the future

## To-Do

- [x] upload dotfiles to git
  - git (.gitconfig, .gitignote, .git-commit-template)
  - hyper: .hyper.js

  - tmux: .tmux.confm
  - vim: .vimrc,
